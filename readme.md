#Recipes 
## How to run
In sep_to_ann is some code that will run all recipes, or the number of cmax recipies. 
Most code is commented out, but could be used to set up the data. This data is already stored in globals.pkl so it should not be generated again except when needed.
At the end of the last loop in sep_to_ann the recipes that are run will have a graph generated, have te graph be evaluated and printed.

recipe.py is de code that will create the graph from a file.
